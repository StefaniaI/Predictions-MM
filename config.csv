mu,1, 'The attributes are normally distributed. This is the mean of the distribution.',,
sigma,3, 'The attributes are normally distributed. This is the standard deviation of the distribution.',,
school_capacity,20, 'How many students can be accepted at each school in one round.',,

eval_criteria,sum, 'How do the evaluation criteria get aggregated into a score. sum --> the evaluation component add up',,
no_students,200, 'The number of students generated each round',,
no_known_schools,1, 'How many schools does a student known before a RS.',,
student_obs_noise,0.05, 'The initial preference of students is obtained from the prestige of the school. The observation is, however, not accurate. The noise gives how much below or above the observation of the student can differ from the actual prestige of the school.'
